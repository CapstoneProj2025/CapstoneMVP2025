          "heading": "Newton's First Law - Inertia",
          "content": "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. This property of matter to resist changes in motion is called inertia."

        {
          "heading": "Newton's Second Law - F=ma",
          "content": "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is expressed as F = ma, where F is force in Newtons, m is mass in kilograms, and a is acceleration in m/s²."

          "heading": "Newton's Third Law - Action-Reaction",
          "content": "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with equal force. This explains how rockets work and why you move backward when jumping off a boat."

          "heading": "What is Work?",
          "content": "In physics, work is done when a force causes displacement. Work = Force × Distance × cos(θ), where θ is the angle between force and displacement. Work is measured in Joules (J)."

          "heading": "Kinetic and Potential Energy",

        {
          "heading": "Power",
          "content": "Power is the rate of doing work or transferring energy. Power = Work / Time, measured in Watts (W). A 100W light bulb uses 100 Joules of energy per second."

          "heading": "Sound Waves",
          "content": "Sound is a longitudinal wave that travels through compression and rarefaction of particles. Speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s at 20°C. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because it needs a medium."

        {
          "heading": "The Doppler Effect",
          "content": "The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave as the source moves relative to the observer. This explains why an ambulance siren sounds higher pitched as it approaches and lower as it moves away."
