          "content": "A circuit is a closed path that allows electricity to flow from a power source, through components, and back to the source. A simple circuit needs a power source (battery), conductors (wires), and a load (light bulb, motor, etc.)."

          "heading": "Ohm's Law",
          "content": "Ohm's Law describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R): V = IR. Voltage is measured in Volts, current in Amperes, and resistance in Ohms (Ω). If voltage increases, current increases proportionally."

        {
          "heading": "Series vs Parallel Circuits",
          "content": "In series circuits, current flows through one path. If one component fails, the entire circuit breaks. In parallel circuits, current has multiple paths. If one path breaks, others continue working. Home wiring uses parallel circuits."

          "heading": "Mechanical Advantage",
          "content": "Mechanical advantage (MA) is the ratio of output force to input force. MA = Output Force / Input Force. A lever with MA = 3 means you can lift 300N with only 100N of force. However, you must move your end 3 times farther."

          "heading": "Efficiency",
          "content": "No machine is 100% efficient due to friction and other energy losses. Efficiency = (Useful Work Out / Total Work In) × 100%. A 75% efficient machine converts 75% of input energy to useful work, losing 25% to heat and friction."

        {
          "heading": "Strength of Shapes",
          "content": "Triangles are the strongest shape because they can't be deformed without changing the length of sides. This is why bridges and towers use triangular trusses. Arches distribute weight effectively by converting vertical forces to compression."

        {
          "heading": "Center of Gravity",
          "content": "The center of gravity is the point where all weight appears to act. Objects with low centers of gravity are more stable. Wide bases and low centers of gravity prevent tipping. This principle is crucial in vehicle and building design."
